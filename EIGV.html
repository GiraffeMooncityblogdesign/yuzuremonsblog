▲１.New Area：｢SUPER NINTENDO WORLD｣<br>

               <p>
From the video and website, it looks like this will be an attraction where you can collect coins using your smartphone. It seems that the coins will be collected by linking the band on your wrist to the official USJ app on your iPhone!<br>
                            </p>      
                            
                 <p>
Nearly three years after it was announced, what kind of attraction will it be? We can't wait to see what it's going to be like.
<br>
                            </p>

▲２.SUPER NINTENDO WORLD is different from COOL JAPAN<br>
</font>
      </p>        
      
        <p>
          <img src= "images/UNIVERSAL.jpg"alt=”100″class="yohaku1"><br>
                          </p>



                    <p>
It tends to be a mixed bag, but SUPER NINTENDO WORLD is a "new area" and is completely separate from Universal Cool Japan.
<br>
                            </p>
                    <p>
At first I thought "Mario in USJ? I was taking a light-hearted stance, thinking "COOL something or other (excuse me) only in Japan is coming to Universiade again?", but it looks like that's not the case, and I was really surprised when the official announcement was made!<br>
                            </p>            
                    <p>
And this time, it looks like a similar facility will be built at Universal Studios in the United States, the home of the game (which is amazing　∑(ﾟДﾟ)）).<br>
                            </p>    
                            
                            
     <p>
Maybe I'm mistaken, but if this is true, I don't think Japan's gaming culture is something to be abandoned.

                                  <p>
There are actually many attractions that you can find at Universal's Studios in the U.S., the home of Universal Studios, but not in Japan.<br>
                            </p>            
                                    <p>
As I recall, Nocturne Alley and Gringotts are facilities that you don't find in Japan.<br>
                                </p>
                                        <p>
However, I think it's difficult to install such so-called "building systems" in the small area of Japan.<br>
                                </p>

How likely is it that the attraction will come to Japan?<br>
</font>
      </p>     
      
      
                                <p>
Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure is relatively easy to build because it doesn't have too large a facility. And personally, I'm pretty excited about it.
<br>
</p>
<p>
In addition, because of the simple concept of a roller coaster-type attraction, I personally think that this is the attraction that will be most likely to be imported and installed in Japan among the attractions that are in operation only overseas. ♪(´ε｀ )！
 <br>
</p>

<p>
However, due to the effects of the coronavirus, I wonder if there will probably be no new attractions installed within the next year. It is a pity.<br>

I'm excited to think that "SUPER NINTENDO WORLD" will become an iconic attraction that will be covered extensively by the news and other media as an attraction that was built at the end of the corona.

I thought this was a lending system, but it looks like they're going to sell it as merchandise. I was quite surprised by this too. (In a good way.)

So far, this is the only information we know about merchandise, but looking at the Universal Studios PR video, there may be some Nintendo character-related stuffed animals for sale. ♪( ´θ｀)ノ<br>
